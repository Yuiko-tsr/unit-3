# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My client Manaha has no prior experience in owning a shop and her new crepe store is currently overloaded with customers. There is no order tracking system or budget/revenue tracking system and there are often times where her orders get confused. Moreover, she is concerned about food waste and she is looking for a system that can track and refer to data in order to estimate the necessary resource that she needs to order in extra. Her current budget is 100 thousand yen. (See evidence of consolation in Appendix A)

## Proposed Solution
A clear and easy UI that allows the client to track budget, orders and resources to organize the orders as well as limit food waste. Moreover, we will add a customer login system that allows clientâ€™s customers to view only the menu they can eat (according to their allergies).
